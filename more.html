    <h1>About Doube Exposure</h1>
    <p>"In film photography, a double exposure is a combination of two exposures in one image to produce evocative results. (Adobe)"</p>

        <h2>My Steps:</h2>
        <p>
            1: Take numerous photos of New York City, and it could be any photo that seems interesting and aesthetically pleasing.
            <br>
            2: Choose a photo as what I call a "main subject", and then double expose the "main subject" photo with another "effect photo" picked from library.
            <br>
            3: Double exposure can be achieved using Adobe Photo shop by overlaying two images and adjusting opacity or using Snapseed's double exposure function with more options and effects including "Lighten", "Darken", "Add", Substract", and "Overlay".
            <br>
            4: Save the processed work of image and repeat previous step to experiment and bring in different "effect photo" until finding one final piece that satisfies me.
            <br>
            5: Then move on to the second piece with the second "main subject" photo.
